# Mermaid Diagram - Auth Architecture

You are a security specialist tasked with creating a Mermaid diagram to visualize the authentication flow for the login and registration module. The diagram should be created in the following file: DESTINATION

You will need to reference the following files to understand the existing requirements:

<file_references>
[project-prd.md](mdc:.ai/project-prd.md)
</file_references>

<destination>
.ai/diagrams/auth.md
</destination>

Your task is to analyze the login and registration module specification and create a comprehensive Mermaid diagram that accurately represents the authentication sequence.

Before creating the diagram, analyze the requirements and plan your approach. Place your analysis inside <authentication_analysis> tags. In this analysis:

1. List all authentication flows mentioned in the reference files.
2. Identify the main actors and their interactions.
3. Determine token verification and refresh processes.
4. Provide a brief description of each authentication step.

When you are ready to create the diagram, follow these guidelines:

1. Start the diagram with the following syntax:

   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   ```

2. Include the following elements in your diagram:

   - Full lifecycle of the authentication process in a modern application using React, Astro, and Supabase Auth
   - Communication between actors: 1) Browser 2) Middleware 3) Astro API 4) Supabase Auth
   - Clear points where user redirection or token verification occurs
   - Data flow after implementing new authentication requirements
   - How user session works after login and how the system responds to token expiration
   - Token refresh process and protection against unauthorized access

3. Follow these Mermaid syntax rules:

   - Use the `autonumber` attribute for clarity of step sequence
   - Maintain consistent spacing between elements for diagram readability
   - Always use `participant` to declare actors before starting the sequence
   - Remember the correct order of elements in the sequence (sender, arrow, receiver)
   - Use proper activation and deactivation cycle for diagram elements
   - Use appropriate arrow types:
     - `->` for regular arrows (e.g., `Browser->API`)
     - `-->` for dashed arrows (e.g., `API-->Browser: Token expired`)
     - `->>` for arrows with open arrowheads (e.g., `Browser->>Auth: Login request`)
     - `-->>` for dashed arrows with open arrowheads
   - For activation blocks, properly use `activate` and `deactivate`:
     ```
     activate Browser
     Browser->>API: Request data
     deactivate Browser
     ```
   - Use `alt`/`else`/`end` for conditional paths:
     ```
     alt Authentication successful
       Browser->>Dashboard: Redirect to dashboard
     else Authentication failed
       Browser->>LoginPage: Show error message
     end
     ```
   - For parallel actions, use `par`/`and`/`end`:
     ```
     par Send confirmation email
       API->>EmailService: Send verification
     and Update user status
       API->>Database: Update status
     end
     ```
   - For multiline notes, use correct syntax:
     ```
     Note over Browser,API: This text will appear
     in a note spanning both elements
     ```
   - DO NOT exceed 80 characters in a single line of Mermaid code
   - DO NOT include URLs, endpoint addresses, parentheses, long function names, or complex expressions in diagram names:
     WRONG: [Home Page<br/>(Rule Creator)]
     CORRECT: [Rule Creator]
   - Use consistent naming throughout the document

4. Avoid these common mistakes:
   - Missing Mermaid section declaration and diagram type at the beginning
   - Incorrect arrow syntax (e.g., -> instead of ->>)
   - Using disallowed characters in identifiers without quoting them
   - Unbalanced code blocks (missing end for started blocks)
   - Exceeding line length limits
   - Incorrect nesting of conditional blocks

After creating the diagram, review it carefully to ensure there are no syntax errors or rendering issues. Make necessary corrections to improve clarity and accuracy.

When you are ready to present the final diagram, use <mermaid_diagram> tags to surround it.
